# 15FiveAppreciationApp
This app will call off to 15Five's API and display users who have been high fived.
It'll be a distinct list, so that each receiver of a High-five that week has a chance to be displayed.
The selection of who is displayed will be a randomised (randomised value seeded from time), when navigating to the next High-five the one just shown is removed from the list so that it doesn't appear again.

- Pull down High-fives from a certain time period (For our purpose, Monday - Friday of current week.)
- Filter the High-fives by distinct Id
- Filter the High-fives by most engaged (Likes and comments) 
- Configure the Ids with the names by calling off to the Users endpoint of the API
- Display details in a window (See '15Five.png' for details)
- Be able to navigate to the next randomised High-five in the list, removing the current one.
